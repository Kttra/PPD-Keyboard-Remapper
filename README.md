# PPD Keyboard Remapper
Remaps PPD controls to be more suitable for keyboard play. I chose the keys after considering keyboard rollover that is a general limitation on laptop keyboards. In addition to remapping the keys, the script has a function to use the mouse as a slider. You can also use it with a graphics tablet to play like in a real arcade. Use "0" and "9" by default to toogle the mouse lock.

**What is Keyboard Rollover?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keyboard rollover is the ability of keyboard to correctly handle several simultaneous keystrokes. If pressing Q, W, and E in sequence without lifting your fingers from any of the three keys generates QWE, the keyboard has 3-key rollover. This is important to consider because PPD requires at times 5 inputs at once. On laptops or some keyboards it is common to be unable to accept more than 3 keys. Distance from the keys may also be a factor. A keyboard may not be able to accept Q, W, E, and R at the same time. However, it may be able to accept Q, W, numpad 3, and numpad 4 at the same time. That is why I have settled for this control scheme, but it is possible to edit it to suit your perference.

     This script expects your configuration to be set to: 
        Triangle = Left Shift 
        Square = Z  
        X = U  
        Circle = I  
        Arrow keys = Normal up, down, left, right  
        Q = Left Slider  
        E = Right Slider
     
     In addition to these mappings, the script will set the following bindings:
        Caplock = Left slider  
        Numpad1 = Left Slider  
        Numpad2 = Left Slider  
        Numpad3 = Right Slider  
        A = Right Slider  
        W = Up  
        S = Down  
        A = Left  
        D = Right
