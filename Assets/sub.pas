{
Glovepie is a programmable input emulator. It is thought to be made for the Wii remote or wiimote but it is not.
It was originally made to emulate the glove 5 hand controller with the computer. It has expanded very far and can handle many different inputs
including voice. GlovePIE stands for Glove programmable input emulator. Glovepie is a simple programming language but is very powerul.
The code in Glovepie can go in almost any order because it’s so simple. It’s coding is very easy to memorize and you could probably have most of it
memorized in a few days. It was programmed in c++, the base computer programming language, so it can do almost anything and has few limits.
